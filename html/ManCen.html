<h3>ManCen</h3>
<p>
The ManCen application is used to track cell centroids. The data gathered calculated then by
d2ras application.
<p>
The main actions are bound to the left mouse button. The actions sets and removes centroids,
which are marked as green ( by default) small circles. These data are stored in .cen files.
<p>
The program is capable of showing neigbour centroids, which are marked as red ( by default) crosses.
Settings that regulate this behaviour are found in "Edit/Preferences/General". 
The box "Display neighbour .cen" shows neighbour centroids ( if available). <br>
The box "look .cen forward" toggles the lookup direction, forward or backward.
<p>
<h3>Calculations</h3>
<p>
ManCen simplifies the tracking of centroids through the series, trying to guess how do
centroids move. When it saves the centroids positions, it confronts neighbour centroids and current ones.
If the number of centroids not match, or if it fails to correspond the points, it warns the user 
about possible problems.
